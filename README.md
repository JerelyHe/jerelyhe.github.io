# **Li He**
I am currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Sydney under the supervision of [Prof. Tongliang Liu](https://tongliang-liu.github.io/index.html).
Additionally, I am very honoured to be a recipient of Data61 Scholarship, with the privilege of being co-supervised by [Prof. Lina Yao](https://www.linayao.com/).

Before joining the University of Sydney, I was a Research Assistant at Westlake University advised by [Prof. Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html).
Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Melbourne, where I received both my Bachelor's degree in Science and Master's degree in Computer Science.

My main research interest is in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
